## Knownledge


Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols that provide security for data as it moves across networks. 

The use of SSL/TLS is most often recognized for its role in securing web traffic, transforming normal HTTP into the secure HTTPS. 

Due to limitations and security concerns, SSL is no longer considered a sufficient method for ensuring secure communications. 

Simply enabling TLS isnâ€™t enough to protect your communications, there are a set of configuration options that should also be set properly in order to assure the confidentiality of network connections. These settings and issues are described in the sections below.
