## Overview

- Understand the code in routes.rb
- Construct your own routes, using either the preferred resourceful style or the match method
- Identify what parameters to expect an action to receive
- Automatically create paths and URLs using route helpers
- Use advanced techniques such as constraints and Rack endpoints


## Basics


The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controllerâ€™s action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.
