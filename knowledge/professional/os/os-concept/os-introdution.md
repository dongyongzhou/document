title: Operating System Introduction

## Overview
 
## What does an Operating System do

Silberschatz and Gavin: “An OS is Similar to a government”

### Coordinator

- Manages all resources
- Settles conflicting requests for resources
- Prevent errors and improper use of the computer

### Facilitator (“useful” abstractions):

- Provides facilities/services that everyone needs
- Standard Libraries, Windowing systems
- Make application programming easier, faster, less error-prone

### Some features reflect both tasks:

- File system is needed by everyone (Facilitator) …
- … but File system must be protected (Traffic Cop)


## What is an Operating System

Most Likely:

- Memory Management
- I/O Management
- CPU Scheduling
- Synchronization / Mutual exclusion primitives
- Communications? (Does Email belong in OS?)
- Multitasking/multiprogramming?

What about?

- File System?
- Multimedia Support?
- User Interface?
- Internet Browser? 

## Sumaary


Operating systems provide a **virtual machine abstraction to handle diverse hardware**

Operating systems coordinate resources and protect users from each other

Operating systems **simplify application development** by providing standard services and abstractions

Operating systems can **provide an array of fault containment, fault tolerance, and fault recovery**
